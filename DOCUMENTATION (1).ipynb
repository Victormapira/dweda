    "# TASK: IMAGE CLASSIFICATION OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS\n",
    "In this task, we aim to develop a computer program capable of analyzing images and categorizing them based on the animals depicted in the pictures. The program will be trained to recognize various species of animals, distinguishing between different classes such as **cattle**, **sheep**, **elephant**, etc. By classifying images according to the animals present, we can facilitate wildlife monitoring efforts and contribute to conservation initiatives\n",

The dataset is divided into five folders names as **elefante_train**,**farfalla_train**,**mucca_train**,**pecora_train** and **scoiattolo_train**. Total number of images in the dataset is 7,002 and images had different sizes.\n",

    "# CHALLENGES WE FACED WHEN WE WERE DOING THIS TASK\n",
    "- **Data collection**: we downloaded a dataset from Kaggle, but it was too big close to 1GB in size. we struggled to download the dataset due to poor  internet connection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image labeling**: Sorting each image into its pollution level category was quite a task. We had to carefully look at each image and decide where it belongs. This took a lot of time and effort because we had to do it manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data formatting**: Getting the labeled images into the right format (COCO JSON) was another challenge. We had to rearrange the data to fit the format properly. It was an important step for training and testing our model, but it wasn't easy and required a lot of attention to detail.\n",
    "-feature engineering:since it was our first time to do this kind of task,it was difficult to choose which tools are suitable for the task ,but in the end we found a solution to complete the feature engineering task"
